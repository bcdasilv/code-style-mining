# code-style-mining
This project aims at mining public software repositories on GitHub in order to map developers' code style. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to mine a huge dataset of public software projects and provide summarized quantitative data to understand how developers program in terms of code style.

Currently this project examines repositories written in Java and Python. In the future, we hope to analyze additional languages. See our [wiki](https://github.com/bcdasilv/code-style-mining/wiki) for more information.

Refer to the branches to checkout our current stage in terms of code style analysis for Python and Java projects.
